    I am currently a sophomore studying Industrial Design at the Rhode Island School of Design. <br>
    I never would've guessed that I'd be majoring in something other than Painting or Ceramics but it's safe to say that I've completely fallen in love with Industrial Design!<br><br>
  </p>

  <p>
    So why Industrial Design? <br>
    The flexibility that comes with brainstorming elastic and ever-changing ideas keeps me fluid, while creative problem solving keeps me sharp and attentive to details. I also thrive in highly collaborative and social environments, making this field the perfect fit for me.<br><br>

    To me, art is play! <br>
    Whether it's a whimsical painting that transports you to another world, or a playfully ugly ceramic figurine that makes you chuckle, or a sleek product design that leaves you satisfied, it's all creative problem solving and puzzles! Art is the truly ultimate playground.<br><br>
