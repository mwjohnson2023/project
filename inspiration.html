	<p>I draw inspiration from several artists who work in a variety of media. One of my first inspirations was cartoonist Charles Barsotti. I have been charmed by his cartoons from a young age; my parents had his illustrations framed around our house and I would find his drawings in the New Yorker. His simple yet ever-playful drawings bring joy to the viewer, and they donâ€™t take themselves too seriously. This playfulness is something I strive to emulate in my own work. I think that creating humor in art is a rewarding skill. As an artist, I find that my mentalities and states of being are reflected in the work that I create, and, reflexively, the work that I make has an effect on how I think and feel. In life, I tend to search for the positive aspects of situations, big or small, because focusing on the things that bring me joy and appreciation are what keep me enjoying life and creating art. Thus, adding small moments of humor and playfulness into my work is a natural part of my artistic process. I love it when a piece makes me smile or laugh, and I find it even more rewarding when I am able to get that reaction out of others. Barsotti was one of my first influences, and I have carried that value of childlike cheer with me throughout my growth as an artist. <br><br>

		I have also been influenced by photographer Hellen van Meene. What I most admire about her work are the delicate and beautiful aesthetics she creates. Her use of lighting, often creating a ghostly or angelic effect, is captivating. Her work inspires me to create beautiful visuals and experiment with natural light. While I do not work primarily in portraiture as she does, her ability to capture emotion is something I admire and seek to do in my own work. I find that her photographs often instill an emotional impression, from excitement to nostalgia to wonder. I am inspired by this ability and hope to be able to create the same effect with my work.
